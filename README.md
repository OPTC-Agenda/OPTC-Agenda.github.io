# OPTC-Agenda.github.io

A brand new agenda for the OPTC Community!

This website provides an agenda view, where you can move forward and backward the different weeks.

**Interesting functions**:
- **A description** for every event in the calendar
- **Settings**: they have a checkbox to choice the events to see (coliseum, fortnight, raid)
- **Set your Time Zone**: you can change the agenda in your Time Zone
- **Special Lvl Up, Free pulls** and other awesome info are showed!

Future developments coming very soon:
- Monthly calendar view
